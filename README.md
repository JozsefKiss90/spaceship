## Stack
- Frontend: JavaScript React
- Backend: Java SpringBoot + Spring Security + JPA
- Database: PostgreSQL

## How to run

### With Docker:
- you need Docker and Docker compose installed.
- clone the repository and be sure to be on "development" branch
- run `docker compose up -d` in the repository root
- wait for it to build and start the containers
- once the containers are running, give a couple seconds for the server to start up, and then you can reach the app on localhost:8080
- you can stop the app with `docker compose stop`

### Without Docker
Database:
- You need to have PostgreSQL installed
- Create a database called `spaceship`
- The backend will by default will expect the db to be running on localhost:5432, if you wish to change that, or use a different name for it, you can do so in the src/main/resources/application.properties file

Backend:
- You need JDK installed
- From the root directory of the project, run `./mvnw clean install` to build the backend
- Once it's built, if the db is in place, you can start it with `java -jar -Dusername={your_database_username} -Dpassword={your_database_password} target/spaceship-0.0.1.jar`
- The server will need a few seconds to start, after that, you can reach it on localhost:8000, if you wish to change that, add --server.port={port_you_want} to the end of the start command

Frontend:
- You need Node.js and npm installed
- Navigate to the frontend directory
- Install dependencies with the `npm ci` command
- The frontend will assume you're running the backend on localhost:8080, if you changed that, you need to update the proxy in the bottom of the package.json file
- You can start the frontend with the `npm run` command, which will make the frontend reachable on localhost:3000, if you want to change that, create a .env.local file, and write PORT={port_you_want} into it before starting the frontend
